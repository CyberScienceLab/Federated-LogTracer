Federated LogTracer is a cutting-edge framework designed to enhance the efficiency, privacy, and automation of log analysis in cybersecurity. By leveraging Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) and advanced contextual data extraction techniques, this system addresses challenges such as centralized log analysis vulnerabilities, lack of contextual insights, and high manual workloads.
________________________________________
Overview
Federated LogTracer introduces a decentralized approach to automated log analysis, focusing on:
•	Preserving log owner privacy.
•	Addressing risks of centralized architectures.
•	Enhancing contextual log data representation.
•	Reducing the manual workload of security analysts.
The framework achieves a 99.4% detection accuracy on the DARPA Transparent Computing dataset and significantly reduces computational complexity while safeguarding privacy.

Features
•	Decentralized Federated Learning: A robust peer-to-peer communication model for model aggregation, eliminating Single Points of Failure (SPOFs).
•	Contextual Data Representation: Extracts and represents meaningful data from raw logs using advanced parse graph techniques.
•	Automated Malicious Path Detection: Efficiently identifies malicious activities within log files.
•	Privacy-Preserving Architecture: Keeps sensitive log data localized while enabling robust analysis.
